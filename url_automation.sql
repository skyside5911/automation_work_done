While the \"Jackass\" guys were way ahead of the trend and have been dropping trou onscreen since 2002, it appears that the rest of Hollywood is finally catching up. In recent years, we\'ve seen stars like Chris Pine and Jack Reynor do full-frontal scenes in \"Outlaw King\" and \"Midsommar,\" respectively, and the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/03/minx-euphoria-tvs-increase-in-full-frontal-male-nudity-prosthetics\" target=\"_blank\">nude scenes</a> on TV and streaming have been even more numerous. Reynor advocated for as <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/midsommar-why-jack-reynor-pushed-full-frontal-nudity-1222326/\" target=\"_blank\">much nudity</a> in his scene as possible, because he loved how much the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/567344/jack-reynor-interview-midsommar/\" target=\"_blank\">scene subverted</a> the way women are often humiliated for the viewer\'s titillation in horror movies. </p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p>Stan expressed similar sentiments, telling <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/pam-and-tommy-talking-penis-recast-1235111763/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that as long as the nudity serves the story, he doesn\'t \"doesn\'t even think twice\" about doing nude scenes anymore:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I feel that women have to have had to do it for so long, and now, it\'s almost like, well, OK, it\'s our turn now. [I\'ll do it] if it\'s not salacious and not purely for grabbing-attention purposes. [...] As long as it\'s being approached from a conversational point of view, where everyone agrees on what it is and we\'re all on the same page, then I think it is OK.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Equal-opportunity nudity is great, honestly, and it\'s lovely to hear stars like Stan embracing a world where more than just female flesh is on display. While some might question the rise in male nudity and whether or not it\'s just crude objectification, women have been forced to bare it all far too often for way too long without much in the way of reciprocation, so it feels fair. As long as everyone\'s a consenting adult, then it\'s time for a pants-off party on TV. Long live 2022, the year of the talking wiener.  </p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n\n</article>', 'https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/sebastian-stans-comments-about-his-pam-tommy-nude-scenes-will-make-you-love-him-even-more/intro-1647793563.jpg', '<article class=\"news-post\">\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p q4\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"q4-top\" data-ad-width=\"any\" id=\"adslot-q4top\"></div>\n<div class=\"main-article\">\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap lead-image-holder\" data-post-id=\"804387\" data-post-title=\"Sebastian Stan\'s Comments About His Pam &amp; Tommy Nude Scenes Will Make You Love Him Even More\" data-post-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/804387/sebastian-stans-comments-about-his-pam-tommy-nude-scenes-will-make-you-love-him-even-more/\" data-slide-num=\"0\">\n<picture>\n<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/sebastian-stans-comments-about-his-pam-tommy-nude-scenes-will-make-you-love-him-even-more/intro-1647793563.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/sebastian-stans-comments-about-his-pam-tommy-nude-scenes-will-make-you-love-him-even-more/intro-1647793563.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n </div>\n<div class=\"byline-container\"> <a class=\"byline-author\" href=\"/author/danielleryan/\"><a class=\"byline-author\" href=\"/author/danielleryan/\">Danielle Ryan</a></a></div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p>There is a lot of nakedness in the second episode of \"Pam &amp; Tommy.\" The scene in which actor Sebastian Stan converses with his penis while under the influence of drugs is voiced by Jason Mantzoukas and is directly taken from Tommy Lee\'s autobiography.

There were other close calls over the years that followed before Tiamut was eventually reawakened with the help of the Eternals\' evil counterparts, the Deviants.

Upon accomplishing their mission (or so they believe) in the year 1500, the Eternals go their separate ways after clashing over their opinions about whether they should continue to avoid interfering in the affairs of humankind as instructed or guide them in their evolution.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p>In the present-day, however, everything changes when the Deviants suddenly resurface, forcing the Eternals to reunite in the face of what they gradually come to realize is a far greater threat that (as you\'ve no doubt pieced together) involves Tiamut. But if you want to know how the story unfolds from there, you\'ll have to check out Chloé Zhao\'s millennium-spanning, divisive, and <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/641297/eternals-review-a-wildly-ambitious-but-tonally-uneven-cosmic-epic/\" target=\"_blank\">more than a little ambitious</a> superhero epic for yourselves.</p>\n\n					\n																		<div class=\"vidad-container\"></div>\n							<div class=\"teads-container\"></div>\n															</div>\n					</div>\n\n\n</article>', 'https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tiamut-in-eternals-explaining-the-celestial/intro-1636140844.jpg', '<article class=\"news-post\">\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p q4\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"q4-top\" data-ad-width=\"any\" id=\"adslot-q4top\"></div>\n<div class=\"main-article\">\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap lead-image-holder\" data-post-id=\"653557\" data-post-title=\"Who Is Tiamut In Eternals?

The main characters of the movie are the titular Olympians, a group of immortal(-ish) humanoid aliens with a variety of superpowers, including superspeed, mind control, and the capacity to project cosmic energy. The Celestials, who created the Eternals, are far more powerful than they are.</p>\n<div id=\"primis-container\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sp = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search); if ( !sp || !sp.has(\"zsource\") || sp.get(\"zsource\") != \"snapchat\" ) { var s = document.createElement(\"SCRIPT\"); s.setAttribute(\"async\", \"async\"); s.type = \"text/javascript\"; s.language = \"javascript\"; s.src = \"https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=109328\"; document.getElementById(\"primis-container\").appendChild(s); }\n</script></div>\n<p>The Celestials are ancient cosmic beings with god-like abilities that have been since (almost) the beginning of time.

Tiamut claims that the other Celestials banded together against him when he attacked Arishem the Judge, one of the select few Celestials who have the authority to decide whether a planet\'s dominant civilisation should live or perish, for refusing to carry out his command to start harvesting Earth. Tiamut\'s physical form was then imprisoned below the planet beneath the Diablo Mountain range in California after they tore his spirit from his body and placed it in a vessel known as The Vial.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p>The chamber where Tiamut\'s body was kept was damaged by the notorious San Francisco earthquake of 1906—the largest earthquake to ever be recorded in the city. This required the Eternals to make repairs and keep Tiamut imprisoned. Before Tiamut was ultimately reawakened with assistance from the Deviants, the evil opposites of the Eternals, there were more close calls over the years that followed. However, the Celestial decided he would decide whether people should live or die for himself rather than quickly killing Earth as he had originally intended.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">What To Expect From Tiamut In Eternals</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"653557\" data-slide-num=\"2\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tiamut-in-eternals-explaining-the-celestial/what-to-expect-from-tiamut-in-eternals-1636140844.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tiamut-in-eternals-explaining-the-celestial/what-to-expect-from-tiamut-in-eternals-1636140844.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p>\"Eternals\" remixes some of Marvel\'s complex comic book mythology while remaining true to other aspects, as is customary for an MCU film.

From the moment she appeared in the trailer, the internet exploded, expressing their immediate obsession with the \"Buff Lady.\" The obsession didn\'t stop after \"Encanto\" made it to theaters, and it picked up even more steam once the film was made available on Disney+. Sure, \"We Don\'t Talk About Bruno\" is the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/737125/we-dont-talk-about-bruno-surpasses-let-it-go-to-become-biggest-disney-song-in-a-quarter-century/\" target=\"_blank\">biggest Disney song</a> in a quarter of a century, but it\'s also the massive popularity of Luisa\'s song \"Surface Pressure\" sung by Jessica Darrow that helped put the \"Encanto\" soundtrack <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/729755/the-encanto-soundtrack-is-now-the-biggest-thing-in-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\">at the top</a> of the Billboard top 100. Despite the love both songs have received, Disney didn\'t submit either as Oscar contenders for Best Original Song, hedging their bets instead on the Spanish-language ballad, \"Dos Oruguitas.\" It\'s a beautiful song, there\'s no denying that, but it\'s the safest possible choice off that soundtrack.</p>\n<div id=\"primis-container\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sp = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search); if ( !sp || !sp.has(\"zsource\") || sp.get(\"zsource\") != \"snapchat\" ) { var s = document.createElement(\"SCRIPT\"); s.setAttribute(\"async\", \"async\"); s.type = \"text/javascript\"; s.language = \"javascript\"; s.src = \"https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=109328\"; document.getElementById(\"primis-container\").appendChild(s); }\n</script></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was obviously no possible way for Disney to have predicted that \"We Don\'t Talk About Bruno\" and \"Surface Pressure\" were going to be the dominant hits over \"Dos Oruguitas,\" but decisions like what to submit to for the Oscars or what merchandise should be made is based heavily on both market testing, and assessing what worked well in the past. Well, \"Encanto\" has completely shaken up the game, as everything about the film has completely dispelled the Disney tradition, and shows that audiences are craving something new.</p>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">Where Is The Family Merch?</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"1\" data-post-id=\"739453\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/where-is-the-family-merch-1642695776.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/where-is-the-family-merch-1642695776.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/where-is-the-family-merch-1642695776.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/739453/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/slide/where-is-the-family-merch/\" data-post-id=\"739453\" data-slide-num=\"1\" data-slide-title=\"The Fight For Luisa\'s Muscles: How Encanto Dispels The Disney Tradition: Where Is The Family Merch?\" width=\"780\" height=\"438\" alt=\"The Family Madrigal in Encanto\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Walt Disney Productions</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder  added-content\">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you take a trip over to the Disney <a href=\"https://www.shopdisney.com/movies-shows/disney/encanto/?&amp;CMP=KNC-DSP_Google_Catch_All_DSA_Campaign&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAip-PBhDVARIsAPP2xc0LTJMLtKyGkTlXwSPv5ngC9AWZxvzotfkkpOLxxx69xOa1JwWO5oIaAjDPEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\">eShop</a> looking for \"Encanto\" merch, it\'s a pretty telling display of what Disney <em>thought</em> was going to be their money maker. There\'s plenty of Mirabel centered merchandise, which should be expected as she\'s the lead. However, when you look at the merchandise centered on the non-Mirabel members of the family, it\'s an entirely different story. Despite the fact that <a href=\"https://people.com/human-interest/2-year-old-boy-lights-up-over-encanto-character-resemblance/\" target=\"_blank\">little boys</a> all around the country are seeing themselves as Antonio, the only Antonio-specific officially licensed toy is a little tree house playset. Isabela, on the other hand, has a garden room play set, a hair play doll, and makeup and jewelry inspired by her outfits. If you\'re a fan of any of the rest of the family Madrigal, you\'ll have to purchase the much more expensive full family sets of figurines or the apparel that shows the whole cast.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is no slight against Isabela, but it\'s pretty obvious to see what happened here. The quiet girl, the strong girl, the anxious girl, and the non-youngest boys weren\'t seen as money makers, but the lead character and the \"beautiful\" sister were. It seems like Disney banked on the fact that outside of the lead, little girls would gravitate toward the pretty and perfect sister who was blessed with the gift to conjure beautiful flowers and plants, the closest thing to a \"princess\" in the film. While Isabela obviously has her fans (the whole family is great, let\'s make that clear) it\'s a shame that the merchandise reflects the perpetuation that beauty is the most important marketing tool for little girls.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">Animators Fought For Luisa\'s Build</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"2\" data-post-id=\"739453\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/animators-fought-for-luisas-build-1642695776.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/animators-fought-for-luisas-build-1642695776.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/animators-fought-for-luisas-build-1642695776.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/739453/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/slide/animators-fought-for-luisas-build/\" data-post-id=\"739453\" data-slide-num=\"2\" data-slide-title=\"The Fight For Luisa\'s Muscles: How Encanto Dispels The Disney Tradition: Animators Fought For Luisa\'s Build\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" alt=\"Luisa lifting pianos\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Walt Disney Productions</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder \">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Even before \"Encanto\" was really off the ground, Disney was already falling into traditional habits that would have likely backfired. When people began freaking out over their love of Luisa Madrigal\'s massive muscles in the trailer, some of the Disney animators on the project confessed that they had <a href=\"https://www.themarysue.com/buff-lady-from-disneys-encanto/\" target=\"_blank\">to fight for her</a> to look the way she did. An animator who has since made their account private in the wake of the film wrote, \"I think we all just wanted to do it in a way that worked well with the style and really made sense for the character and I\'m really proud of the way that she turned out.\" Luisa\'s super-strength and song \"Surface Pressure\" are two of the most popular aspects of the film, and it\'s a bummer that no one had the foresight to think that audiences would want to express that love with their wallets.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Encanto\" is a touching film that deals with generational trauma and familial obligation, two themes that resonate deeply with a huge chunk of the population. As the \"fix it, please\" and largest statured daughter of the family myself, Luisa resonated with me on an almost religious level. As it stands, I have to purchase designs by Etsy creators who have yet to be slapped with a cease and desist from Disney, because it seems like those in charge of merchandising and marketing didn\'t anticipate that audiences would embrace her the way they have. Considering they allegedly wanted to shrink her down and not allow her to be tall, strong, and built, Disney clearly felt like Luisa needed to be more or less of the same, and concerned what it would mean to break tradition.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n																		<div class=\"vidad-container\"></div>\n							<div class=\"teads-container\"></div>\n															</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">Breaking Generational Curses</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"3\" data-post-id=\"739453\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/breaking-generational-curses-1642695776.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/breaking-generational-curses-1642695776.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/breaking-generational-curses-1642695776.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/739453/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/slide/breaking-generational-curses/\" data-post-id=\"739453\" data-slide-num=\"3\" data-slide-title=\"The Fight For Luisa\'s Muscles: How Encanto Dispels The Disney Tradition: Breaking Generational Curses\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" alt=\"Bruno and Mirabel in Encanto\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Walt Disney Productions</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder  added-content\">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">If it sounds like I am being too hard on Disney, please understand that my criticism is coming from a place of love and appreciation. Growing up, I was always a Disney kid. Disney movies were and continue to be some of the biggest influences in my life, but I would be lying if I said that they don\'t also contribute to cycles that are meant to be broken. Disney animated features need to have better representation. Not everyone looks like a princess, nor do they aspire to be one. \"Encanto\" is a revolutionary effort from the House of Mouse, and I do not want anyone to feel as if my complaints are coming from a place of bad faith.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Disney is the most powerful corporation in the entertainment industry today. They have more money and more influence than anyone else, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to hold them to a higher standard. The central conceit of \"Encanto\" is learning how to break generational curses and understanding that tradition for the sake of tradition doesn\'t always help everyone. Progress is important, change is good, and not talking about the problems in your life do not magically make them go away. Everything changed for the Madrigal family when they finally talked about Bruno, and it\'s time that we finally have a talk with Disney about the ways they can break their own traditions.

The internet erupted the moment she debuted in the teaser, expressing people\'s instant obsession with the \"Buff Lady.\" After \"Encanto\" in theatres, the fixation persisted, and it intensified after the movie was made accessible on Disney+. It\'s true that \"We Don\'t Talk About Bruno\" is the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/737125/we-dont-talk-about-bruno-surpasses-let-it-go-to-become-biggest-disney-song-in-a-quarter-century/\" target=\"_blank\">biggest Disney song</a> in 25 years, but Jessica Darrow\'s performance of Luisa\'s song \"Surface Pressure\" also enjoyed tremendous success, propelling the \"Encanto\" soundtrack to the top of the Billboard top 100. Despite the positive reception both songs have gotten, Disney decided to place their hopes on the Spanish-language ballad \"Dos Oruguitas\" rather than submitting either as candidates for the Oscar for Best Original Song. There is no disputing that it is a wonderful song, but it is also the most secure selection from the album.</p>\n<div id=\"primis-container\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sp = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search); if ( !sp || !sp.has(\"zsource\") || sp.get(\"zsource\") != \"snapchat\" ) { var s = document.createElement(\"SCRIPT\"); s.setAttribute(\"async\", \"async\"); s.type = \"text/javascript\"; s.language = \"javascript\"; s.src = \"https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=109328\"; document.getElementById(\"primis-container\").appendChild(s); }\n</script></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Disney could never have predicted that \"We Don\'t Talk About Bruno\" and \"Surface Pressure\" would outperform \"Dos Oruguitas,\" but decisions about what to nominate for the Oscars or what merchandise to produce are frequently based on market research as well as analysis of what has previously worked well. The movie \"Encanto\" has radically changed the rules because it completely breaks with Disney tradition and demonstrates that viewers are looking for something fresh.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">Where Is The Family Merch?</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"739453\" data-slide-num=\"1\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/where-is-the-family-merch-1642695776.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/where-is-the-family-merch-1642695776.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Walt Disney Productions</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">You may get a very good idea of what Disney anticipated would be their money generator by visiting the Disney<a href=\"https://www.shopdisney.com/movies-shows/disney/encanto/?&amp;CMP=KNC-DSP_Google_Catch_All_DSA_Campaign&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAip-PBhDVARIsAPP2xc0LTJMLtKyGkTlXwSPv5ngC9AWZxvzotfkkpOLxxx69xOa1JwWO5oIaAjDPEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\">eShop</a> and shopping for \"Encanto\" merchandise. Since Mirabel plays the lead character, there is a lot of products featuring her. It\'s a whole different scenario, though, when you look at the items featuring the family members who aren\'t named Mirabel. The only officially approved Antonio item is a small tree house playset, despite the fact that <a href=\"https://people.com/human-interest/2-year-old-boy-lights-up-over-encanto-character-resemblance/\" target=\"_blank\">little boys</a> all around the country identify with Antonio. In contrast, Isabela has a play set for her garden room, a doll with play hair, and jewellery and makeup that are based on her clothing. You\'ll need to get the considerably more expensive full family sets of figurines or the clothing that features the entire cast if you\'re a fan of any of the other Madrigal family members.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Isabela is not being disparaged in any way, but what transpired in this case is rather clear. The main character and the \"pretty\" sister were viewed as money earners, but the quiet girl, the powerful girl, the worried girl, and the older lads weren\'t. Outside of the main character, it appears that Disney bet on the notion that young girls would be drawn to the attractive and ideal sister who was endowed with the ability to conjure lovely flowers and plants, the closest thing to a \"princess\" in the movie. While Isabela undoubtedly has followers (the whole family is wonderful, let\'s be clear), it\'s unfortunate that the goods supports the idea that attractiveness is the most effective marketing strategy for young girls.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">Animators Fought For Luisa\'s Build</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"739453\" data-slide-num=\"2\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/animators-fought-for-luisas-build-1642695776.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/animators-fought-for-luisas-build-1642695776.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Walt Disney Productions</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Before \"Encanto\" had even begun to take off, Disney was already slipping into old practises that would have probably backfired. When fans of Luisa Madrigal\'s enormous muscles in the teaser started freaking out, several of the Disney animators working on the film admitted that they had to fight to make her look the way she did. I believe we all just wanted to execute it in a way that went well with the aesthetic and truly made sense for the character, and I\'m really proud of the way that she turned out, wrote an animator who has since made their account private in the wake of the film. It\'s unfortunate that no one had the foresight to anticipate that viewers would want to show their affection for the movie with their dollars. Luisa\'s super-strength and the song \"Surface Pressure\" are two of the most well-liked features of the movie.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A large portion of the populace may relate strongly to the themes of generational trauma and familial obligation in the moving movie \"Encanto.\" As the tallest and \"fix it, please\" daughter of the family, Luisa spoke to me on a nearly holy level. As things stand, I\'m forced to buy items from Etsy designers who haven\'t yet received a cease and desist letter from Disney because it looks like people in charge of merchandise and marketing didn\'t expect audiences to adore her in the same manner they have. Disney obviously believed that Luisa needed to be more or less the same and was concerned about what it would mean to break precedent, especially given that they allegedly intended to shrink her down and prevent her from being big, muscular, and robust.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<div class=\"vidad-container\"></div>\n<div class=\"teads-container\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">Breaking Generational Curses</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"739453\" data-slide-num=\"3\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/breaking-generational-curses-1642695776.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-fight-for-luisas-muscles-how-encanto-dispels-the-disney-tradition/breaking-generational-curses-1642695776.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Walt Disney Productions</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">If it seems like I\'m criticising Disney too harshly, please know that my praise and admiration are what motivate me. I always loved Disney as a child. I would be lying if I said that Disney movies weren\'t some of the major inspirations in my life, but they do contribute to cycles that should be broken. It is necessary to have better representation in Disney animated films. Not everyone aspires to be a princess and not everyone looks like one. I don\'t want anyone to think that my criticisms of \"Encanto,\" a groundbreaking endeavour from the House of Mouse, are made in ill faith.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Disney is currently the most powerful company in the entertainment sector. There is nothing wrong with wanting to hold them to a higher standard because they are the ones with the most power and money. The main plot of \"Encanto\" revolves about discovering how to overcome generational curses and realising that tradition for tradition\'s sake doesn\'t always benefit everyone. Change is good, progress is vital, and difficulties in your life do not magically disappear if you don\'t talk about them. It\'s time we finally have a chat with Disney about how they can break their own traditions. Everything changed for the Madrigal family when they finally discussed Bruno. Have faith that everyone will benefit from it.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article', b'1', 1, b'1');

Writer-director Ari Aster\'s sophomore feature follows Dani (Florence Pugh) and Jack (Jack Raynor) as they travel, along with a few friends, to the remote Swedish village of Harga on a senior thesis trip where they plan to study the locals\' customs and attend their midsummer festival. But they soon discover that the cultish Hargans participate in some pretty disturbing rituals (to say the least), and that their odds of escaping the village are slim.</p>\n<div id=\"primis-container\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sp = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search); if ( !sp || !sp.has(\"zsource\") || sp.get(\"zsource\") != \"snapchat\" ) { var s = document.createElement(\"SCRIPT\"); s.setAttribute(\"async\", \"async\"); s.type = \"text/javascript\"; s.language = \"javascript\"; s.src = \"https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=109328\"; document.getElementById(\"primis-container\").appendChild(s); }\n</script></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The events of \"Midsommar\" culminate in a twisted but cathartic ending that had anyone who\'s ever been involved in a bad relationship saying, \"Yas queen.\" But it\'s also a movie about how we deal or don\'t deal with trauma, and how unprocessed trauma or grief can impact our lives and the lives of those we love. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fans of \"Midsommar\" may be interested in seeking out similar horror films to watch, whether they be about cults, bad relationships, grief, trauma, solid folk horror films with freaky endings, or some combination of all of the above. We\'re happy to help in that endeavor by providing a list of 15 movies like \"Midsommar\" that will surely keep you up at night.</p>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">Hereditary</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"1\" data-post-id=\"676286\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/hereditary-1638309421.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/hereditary-1638309421.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/hereditary-1638309421.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/676286/movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/slide/hereditary/\" data-post-id=\"676286\" data-slide-num=\"1\" data-slide-title=\"15 Movies Like Midsommar That Will Surely Give You A Scare: Hereditary\" width=\"780\" height=\"438\" alt=\"toni collette hereditary fire\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">A24</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder  added-content\">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ari Aster\'s first feature, \"Hereditary\" (2008), shares many traits with his second, including the fact that both films feature freaky storylines involving ritualistic cults. Both serve as metaphors exploring the horrors of family trauma and the devastating effects it can have on one\'s mental state and relationships, and both culminate in an intense and shocking ending.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The \"Hereditary\" storyline revolves around a family led by Annie (Toni Collette), whose own mother dies at the beginning of the movie, leaving her in a state of grief. When a second tragedy strikes the family, it sends Annie spiraling, and things only get much worse when it becomes clear that a demon named Paimon is involved. Just as we wonder whether Dani will succumb to the Harga cult in \"Midsommar,\" we wonder whether Annie will be able to save herself and her remaining family members from Paimon\'s curse (we learn her mother was in fact, a worshipper).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With strong supporting performances by Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro and Gabriel Byrne, \"Hereditary\" offers a thought-provoking and intensely disturbing family portrait that is almost guaranteed to mess you up.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">The Wicker Man</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"2\" data-post-id=\"676286\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/the-wicker-man-1638309421.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/the-wicker-man-1638309421.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/the-wicker-man-1638309421.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/676286/movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/slide/the-wicker-man/\" data-post-id=\"676286\" data-slide-num=\"2\" data-slide-title=\"15 Movies Like Midsommar That Will Surely Give You A Scare: The Wicker Man\" width=\"780\" height=\"438\" alt=\"The Wicker Man Christopher Lee ending\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">British Lion Films</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder \">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you\'re a fan of \"Midsommar,\" then you\'ll want to make sure you\'ve seen one of its biggest influences, \"The Wicker Man\" (1973).

When he arrives, however, he\'s given the runaround by the island\'s free-wheeling, paganistic inhabitants, all of whom are busily preparing for their upcoming May Day celebration.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eventually, Sergeant Howie meets the enigmatic Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who reveals the terrifying true intentions behind their festival. Like the Harga of \"Midsommar,\" the residents of Summerisle have their own disturbing rituals.

The second film by writer-director Ari Aster follows Dani (Florence Pugh) and Jack (Jack Raynor) as they embark on a final thesis trip with a few companions to the isolated Swedish village of Harga where they want to investigate the local traditions and attend their midsummer festival. However, they quickly learn that their chances of leaving the town are minimal as the cultish Hargans engage in some fairly frightening rites.</p>\n<div id=\"primis-container\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sp = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search); if ( !sp || !sp.has(\"zsource\") || sp.get(\"zsource\") != \"snapchat\" ) { var s = document.createElement(\"SCRIPT\"); s.setAttribute(\"async\", \"async\"); s.type = \"text/javascript\"; s.language = \"javascript\"; s.src = \"https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=109328\"; document.getElementById(\"primis-container\").appendChild(s); }\n</script></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anyone who has ever been in a horrible relationship would say, \"Yas queen,\" at the twisted but cathartic conclusion of \"Midsommar.\" But it\'s also a film about how we handle trauma, or how we don\'t handle it, and how unprocessed trauma or grief may affect our lives and the lives of the people we care about.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fans of \"Midsommar\" might be interested in looking for other scary movies to watch that are similar to it, whether they are about cults, unhappy relationships, grief, trauma, good folk horror movies with weird endings, or some mix of all of the above. We\'re pleased to assist with that effort by offering a list of 15 films that are similar to \"Midsommar\" that will undoubtedly keep you up at night.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">Hereditary</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"676286\" data-slide-num=\"1\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/hereditary-1638309421.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/hereditary-1638309421.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">A24</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">There are many similarities between Ari Aster\'s first and second films, notably the fact that both of them have bizarre plots involving ritualistic cults. Both stories culminate in an explosive and stunning conclusion and serve as metaphors for the horrors of familial trauma and the terrible impact it can have on one\'s mental health and relationships.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The \"Hereditary\" plot centres on a family lead by Annie (Toni Collette), whose mother passes away at the start of the picture, leaving her inconsolable. Annie is sent into a tailspin when a second tragedy strikes the family, and things only get much worse when it becomes obvious that a demon by the name of Paimon is involved. We ponder whether Dani will fall victim to the Harga cult in \"Midsommar\" just as we ponder whether Annie will be able to escape Paimon\'s curse and protect herself and her remaining family members (we learn her mother was in fact, a worshipper).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The movie \"Hereditary,\" which stars Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro, and Gabriel Byrne in supporting roles, presents a deeply unsettling familial portrait that is almost certain to unsettle you.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">The Wicker Man</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"676286\" data-slide-num=\"2\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/the-wicker-man-1638309421.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/the-wicker-man-1638309421.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">British Lion Films</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure you\'ve seen \"The Wicker Man,\" one of \"Midsommar\'s\" main influences, if you\'re a fan (1973). The film, which Robin Hardy directed, is a classic in the folk horror subgenre and was voted as the fourth best horror movie of all time by The Guardian.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) is shown in \"The Wicker Man\" as he journeys to the isolated Hebridean island of Summerisle to look into the disappearance of a little girl. He finds the island\'s free-spirited, paganism-inclined residents giving him the runaround as they all work feverishly to prepare for their forthcoming May Day festival.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sergeant Howie eventually crosses paths with the mysterious Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who exposes the horrifying real purpose of their festival. The inhabitants of Summerisle practise their own sinister rituals, much like the Harga in \"Midsommar.\" A fiery sacrifice also threatens individuals who don\'t belong, much like in \"Midsommar.\"</p>\n<div class=\"vidad-container\"></div>\n<div class=\"teads-container\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">Rosemary\'s Baby</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"676286\" data-slide-num=\"3\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/rosemarys-baby-1638309421.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/15-movies-like-midsommar-that-will-surely-give-you-a-scare/rosemarys-baby-1638309421.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Paramount Pictures</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Another scary horror movie about a lady in a poor relationship who gets caught in a cult is \"Rosemary\'s Baby\" (1968).

Maud, a devout Catholic who discovered religion as a result of unknown painful experiences, comes to believe that it is up to her to preserve Amanda\'s soul and makes attempts to convert her. Maud interprets Amanda\'s rejection of her efforts and her expulsion as a rejection from God himself. She increases her devotion since she feels like she has let Him down, which results in an unexpected outcome.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Similarities between Saint Maud and other movies like \"Carrie\" and \"Taxi Driver\" can be seen.

The novel — about a group of seven friends who are stalked by a demonic, shape-shifting clown that lives in the sewers under their small Maine hometown — spans two time periods: Half of the book takes place in the 1950s when the protagonists were hovering around age 12, and half takes place in the present day, when the protagonists had grown into unhappy adults, still haunted by memories of their childhood nemesis. The book alternates between these two time frames, showing how facing a demon — and your deepest fears — as a child, can lead to trauma and dysfunction as an adult. Ultimately the clown must be confronted again in the 1980s. </p>\n<div id=\"primis-container\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sp = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search); if ( !sp || !sp.has(\"zsource\") || sp.get(\"zsource\") != \"snapchat\" ) { var s = document.createElement(\"SCRIPT\"); s.setAttribute(\"async\", \"async\"); s.type = \"text/javascript\"; s.language = \"javascript\"; s.src = \"https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=109328\"; document.getElementById(\"primis-container\").appendChild(s); }\n</script></div>\n<p>The mythology of \"It\" is complex and baffling. Although it\'s not covered in the movies and the TV miniseries adaptations, the novel explains that the evil shapeshifting clown Pennywise is, in fact, an ancient, eldritch spider demon from another dimension that \"surrounds\" known space. Pennywise came to Earth centuries ago, and has been regularly stalking the humans of Derry, Maine, ever since. Every 27 years, Pennywise awakens from its hibernation cycle to feed on human meat. It learned long ago that human being are tastier when in a state of abject fear, and, as such, learned to read people\'s thoughts and take the form of whatever they feared most.

Bifurcated like the miniseries, the first \"It\" from took place in the past with the protagonists as children, only now time-shifted forward to the late 1980s. \"<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/568831/it-chapter-two-review/\" target=\"_blank\">It Chapter Two</a>,\" written by just Dauberman, was released in 2019, and took place in the present day with a new cast of adults. Not to be outdone, however, \"It Chapter Two\" also included extended flashbacks with the same young actors from the first chapter. In toto, the two \"It\" feature films added up to 304 minutes. </p>\n<p>While the story concluded at the end of \"It Chapter Two,\" and the Clown Demon (played by Bill Skarsgård) was once again bested by the bravery and resourcefulness of the characters, there was still a lot left unexplored. The turtle god wasn\'t addressed, for one. Secondly, the kids from the 2017 film did a lot of their own research into the past of Pennywise, finding scary old photos and film reels wherein Pennywise first took the form of a clown. This implied a much broader backstory for Pennywise, likely rife with terrifying episodes of people being tormented and eaten over the course of Derry\'s dark history.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p>The \"It\" feature films had many fans, and some wondered if the unaddressed history of Pennywise would grace the big screen again.

Two periods are covered in the book about a group of seven friends who are being followed by a demonic, shape-shifting clown that resides beneath their small Maine town: The first part of the book takes place in the 1950s when the protagonists are somewhere between 12 and 14 years old, and the second half is set in the current day when the protagonists have become miserable adults who are still plagued by flashbacks to their childhood foe. The novel switches back and forth between these two eras to illustrate how confronting a monster and your worst fears as a child may result in trauma and dysfunction as an adult. The 1980s will ultimately require another confrontation with the clown.</p>\n<div id=\"primis-container\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sp = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search); if ( !sp || !sp.has(\"zsource\") || sp.get(\"zsource\") != \"snapchat\" ) { var s = document.createElement(\"SCRIPT\"); s.setAttribute(\"async\", \"async\"); s.type = \"text/javascript\"; s.language = \"javascript\"; s.src = \"https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=109328\"; document.getElementById(\"primis-container\").appendChild(s); }\n</script></div>\n<p>The \"It\" mythology is convoluted and perplexing. The novel explains that the wicked shape-shifting clown Pennywise is actually an old, eldritch spider monster from another dimension that \"surrounds\" known space, even if this isn\'t mentioned in the films or TV miniseries adaptations. Since his arrival on Earth aeons ago, Pennywise has been pursuing the residents of Derry, Maine, on a regular basis. Pennywise breaks out of its hibernation cycle once every 27 years to consume human flesh. It long ago discovered that people are tastier when they are experiencing extreme terror, and as a result, it learnt to read people\'s minds and adopt the form of whatever they were most afraid of.

One was that the turtle god wasn\'t mentioned. Second, the children in the 2017 movie performed a lot of their own research into Pennywise\'s origins and discovered spooky old photographs and movie reels from the time when Pennywise initially assumed the guise of a clown.

As witnessed in \"The Clone Wars\" series, his ancestor Pre Vizsla, eventual leader of House Vizsla and the Death Watch terrorist faction, would flaunt the blade to strike down Jedi, ambush Obi-Wan Kenobi, and commit atrocities on Carlac. Fallen Sith Maul would later successfully duel Pre for the blade, thus claiming the conquered seat of Mandalore for a short-lived regime. Then during the reign of the Galactic Empire, Sabine Wren of Clan Wren salvaged the blade from Maul\'s lair on Dathomir. Using her judgment, Sabine then granted it to Bo-Katan Kryze based on the latter\'s leadership experience and pledges of supports from Mandalorian warrior clans. But in the aftermath of the Night of A Thousand Tears, Kryze would lose the Darksaber and it would land in Gideon\'s nefarious grip.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p>Tarre Vizsla\'s Mandalorian warrior identity and his Jedi mantle places him in a fascinating intersection. Prior to his induction with the Jedi Temple, Jedi and Mandalorians warred against each other and those conflicts burned on after his death. Mandalorians forged and smelted the beskar armor and weapons to outmatch or rival the powers of the Jedi — \"enemy sorcerers,\" as Djarin understands them in the Armorer\'s story. This raises some questions that would be a gold (beskar) mine for anyone who might tackle the IP novel. How was young Tarre scouted by Jedi? A Mandalorian clan wouldn\'t be likely to sign off on a child joining enemy sorcerers. Was Tarre from a known clan? Paz Vizsla also affirms Tarre as a \"founder\" of the powerful House Vizsla. Was he an orphan?</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p>How did Tarre navigate the space of a Jedi Temple? How did he harvest the kyber crystal that powered the Darksaber? How much approval then did Tarre attain from the Jedi Council to partake in the affairs of his homeworld to become a ruler\"? Speculatively, Vizsla\'s Jedi induction and his eventual presence on Mandalore could be interpreted as defusing the tension between Jedi and Mandalorian.</p>\n<p>Tarre Vizsla left an incalculable impact on Mandalorian history. But disregarding the always-disputed Darksaber, in-universe discourse about Tarre Vizsla, his politics, his practices have yet to surface. \"Star Wars\" illuminated a myriad of Mandalorians sects and practices: from the orthodox Children of Watch that adopted and educated Djarin, the extremist Death Watch (that may have ties to the Children of the Watch as indicated by the armor insignia of Mandos who rescued a young Djarin), Bo-Katan Kryze\'s splintered Nite Owls from Death Watch, New Mandalorians under Satine Kryze\'s pacifist rule which renounced weapons and beskar armor. You could bet you ask any Mandalorian their extensive opinion of Tarre Vizsla\'s historical influence and expect unique answers.</p>\n\n					\n																		<div class=\"vidad-container\"></div>\n							<div class=\"teads-container\"></div>\n															</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">Tarre Vizsla\'s Eyes on the Future</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"3\" data-post-id=\"755349\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/tarre-vizslas-eyes-on-the-future-1643836649.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/tarre-vizslas-eyes-on-the-future-1643836649.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/tarre-vizslas-eyes-on-the-future-1643836649.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/755349/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/slide/tarre-vizslas-eyes-on-the-future/\" data-post-id=\"755349\" data-slide-num=\"3\" data-slide-title=\"Who Is Tarre Vizsla, The First Mandalorian Jedi?: Tarre Vizsla\'s Eyes on the Future\" width=\"780\" height=\"438\" alt=\"Clan Wren siblings admiring the statue of Tarre Vizsla\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<a href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jedipedia/images/7/73/Statue_von_Tarre_Vizsla.png/revision/latest?cb=20200310104310&amp;path-prefix=de\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Disney</span></a>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder  added-content\">\n															<p></p><p>Tarre Vizsla may be a specter, but he\'s nonetheless the specter who illuminates the arcs of those in proximity to the Darksaber. Note that whenever Tarre Vizsla\'s name has been invoked so far (besides \"Forces of Destiny\"), adoptive father figures are always the one who absorb his story. Onscreen, the lore of Tarre Vizsla was first told to Kanan Jarrus, the Jedi who trained Sabine Wren to wield the saber. Now, the Armorer tells it to Djarin, Grogu\'s Mandalorian guardian.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p>In \"Trials of the Darksaber,\" one of the greatest \"Rebels\" episode, a major theme of Sabine\'s Darksaber arc is that family — blood relation or found — shape your perspective and ethos in the galaxy. Sabine is a Mandalorian outcast who was informally \"adopted\" by a Jedi and received lightsaber training despite her non-Force-sensitive status. In an inversion of Sabine\'s upbringing, Grogu is a Force-sensitive non-human Jedi youngling who ends up adopted by a Mando in beskar. So powerful is Grogu and Djarin\'s bond that Djarin bestows Mandalorian heirlooms, his Mando pendant and later the beskar chainmail armor forged by the Armorer. Although Djarin has situated Grogu with the Jedi Luke Skywalker, Djarin is intent on not letting Grogu forget his Mandalorian ties.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p>As season 3 of \"The Mandalorian\" looms on the horizon when season 1 of \"The Book of Boba Fett\" concludes, the weapon of Tarre Vizsla is set on a clouded path. The most obvious obstacle is that Djarin has yet to master mental clarity to properly swing the Darksaber — \"Your body is strong, but your mind is distracted,\" preaches the Armorer. Likely, this would involve his personal turmoils with his Mandalorian identity, in part because the Children of the Watch reject him but he still wears the beskar and its principles. Fans perceive the honorable Din Djarin, a Mando not born of a powerful bloodline, as an ideal candidate to rally all kinds of fractured Mandalorians to rebuild Mandalore. For one, he values solidarity despite his loner status. Two, living up to the Darksaber\'s symbolism of Mandalorian leadership might help him engage more in Mandalorian history, something which he is still learning. Perhaps to the chagrin of Paz Vizsla, Din\'s background subverts the nobility ties that often accompany the Vizslas\' claim to the sword and leadership.</p>\n<p>If Moff Gideon\'s taunt is any foreshadowing, Grogu might be the narrative candidate to wield the Darksaber (hopefully not involving him defeating Djarin). It makes thematic sense. The Darksaber represents one Mandalorian\'s cohesion of his Mando-Jedi heritage. In <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/754373/the-book-of-boba-fett-delivers-expected-surprises-in-from-the-desert-comes-a-stranger/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 6 of \"Book of Boba Fett,\"</a> Luke Skywalker lays out the either-this-or-that choices before Grogu: the traditional lightsaber or the beskar chainmail armor. It\'s hard not to imagine Grogu\'s development may be reconciling his Jedi roots and his Mandalorian upbringing, and the Darksaber would be that perfect symbolism.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p>Can you imagine if even Tarre himself had to learn to lift his own blade when navigating two worlds? He remains a historical influencer, a trove of curiosity, and an omnipresence. He may have ascended to the Cosmic Force, yet he\'s relevant to Din Djarin and Grogu\'s bond. The Jedi, Mandalorian, ruler, an ancestor, he\'s the ghost that watches over a future always in motion for the Djarin clan of two.</p>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n\n</article>', 'https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/intro-1643836649.jpg', 'article class=\"news-post\">\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p q4\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"q4-top\" data-ad-width=\"any\" id=\"adslot-q4top\"></div>\n<div class=\"main-article\">\n<h1 class=\"title-gallery\" data-post-id=\"755349\" id=\"title-gallery\">Who Is Tarre Vizsla, The First Mandalorian Jedi?</h1>\n</div>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap lead-image-holder\" data-post-id=\"755349\" data-post-title=\"Who Is Tarre Vizsla, The First Mandalorian Jedi?\" data-post-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/755349/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/\" data-slide-num=\"0\">\n<picture>\n<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/intro-1643836649.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/intro-1643836649.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<a href=\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fdorksideoftheforce.com%2Ffiles%2F2020%2F12%2Fthe-mandalorian-chapter-16-the-child-the-mandalorian-04ybfiw74.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"gallery-image-credit\"><a href=\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fdorksideoftheforce.com%2Ffiles%2F2020%2F12%2Fthe-mandalorian-chapter-16-the-child-the-mandalorian-04ybfiw74.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Disney+</span></a></span></a> </div>\n<div class=\"byline-container\"><span class=\"byline-by\">By</span> <a class=\"byline-author\" href=\"/author/carolinecao/\"><a class=\"byline-author\" href=\"/author/carolinecao/\">Caroline Cao</a></a><span class=\"byline-timestamp\"><span class=\"byline-slash\">/</span>Feb. 2, 2022  4:24 pm EDT</span></div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p>A captivating Star Wars story called Tarre Vizsla has the potential to inspire countless IP tie-ins, books, comics, and multi-chapter fanfictions (this writer here attempted and failed that endeavor). When the Armorer informs the titular Din Djarin about the Darksaber\'s initial user and creator in Chapter 5 of \"The Book of Boba Fett,\" she invokes the a thousand-year-old legend of Mandalorian Jedi Tarre Vizsla.

Tradition holds that the only way to take the Darksaber from him is through a fair fight, which Tarre\'s ancestor Paz Vizsla attempted but failed to do. What do we know about the Darksaber\'s original maker and wielder, though, despite the fact that it is the focal point of Mandalorian conflict?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">The Haze of History</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"755349\" data-slide-num=\"1\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/the-haze-of-history-1643836649.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/the-haze-of-history-1643836649.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<a href=\"https://www.thathashtagshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tarre-vizsla2-1024x576.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"gallery-image-credit\"><a href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jedipedia/images/7/73/Statue_von_Tarre_Vizsla.png/revision/latest?cb=20200310104310&amp;path-prefix=de\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Disney</span></a></span></a> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p>Tarre Vizsla, who lived during the time of the Old Republic, originally appeared as a parrying silhouette in the \"Rebels\" season three episode \"Trials of the Darksaber,\" which is regarded as one of the best animated Star Wars scenes and highlights the legendary malleability of history.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p>Like many Padawans, Tarre Vizsla drew inspiration from his past when creating his lightsaber. The revelation made in \"Book of Boba Fett\" is that the Darksaber hilt is made of beskar, the Mandalorian metal that is smelted into the Mandalorian sigil armour. Another revelation is made when Tarre reappears as a statue in a \"Forces of Destiny\" short: he is considered as the monarch of Mandalore, explaining how the Darksaber came to be associated with leadership. His administration\'s elaborate specifics are largely kept a secret.</p>\n<p>Tarre appeared to have built his sabre (whether intentionally or unintentionally; it\'s unknown if he ever intended for a legacy to carry his sabre) for a person of mental toughness. The sabre will literally weigh down the user and make it difficult for them to fight for people who struggle with self-worth. In \"Rebels,\" Sabine Wren experiences its weight, which exemplifies it.

Fallen Sith Maul would subsequently defeat Pre in a combat for the blade, seizing control of Mandalore for a brief period of time. The blade was later recovered from Maul\'s stronghold on Dathomir by Sabine Wren of Clan Wren during the Galactic Empire\'s rule. Bo-Katan Kryze was then given it by Sabine using her judgement based on the latter\'s experience as a leader and the promises of support from the Mandalorian warrior clans. However, Kryze would misplace the Darksaber after the Night of a Thousand Tears, and it would end up in Gideon\'s evil hands.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p>Tarre Vizsla finds himself in an intriguing crossroads because of his dual identities as a Mandalorian warrior and a Jedi. The tensions between Jedi and Mandalorians that existed prior to his enrollment into the Jedi Temple continued even after his passing. To match or rival the abilities of the Jedi \"enemy sorcerers,\" as Djarin perceives them in the Armorer\'s tale, Mandalorians built and smelted the beskar armour and weapons. This brings up several issues that could prove to be a gold (beskar) mine for anyone attempting the IP novel. How did Jedi spy on young Tarre? A clan of Mandalorians wouldn\'t likely approve of a kid joining their rival sorcerers. Tarre was a member of a reputed clan. Tarre is acknowledged by Paz Vizsla as a \"founder\" of the mighty House Vizsla. Was he a child?</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p>How did Tarre get around inside a Jedi Temple? He harvested the kyber crystal needed to power the Darksaber, but how? How much support did Tarre ultimately receive from the Jedi Council to participate in the politics of his homeworld and eventually become its ruler? It\'s possible to speculate that Vizsla\'s admission into the Jedi Order and her arrival in Mandalore served to ease tensions between the Jedi and Mandalorians.</p>\n<p>The legacy of Tarre Vizsla on Mandalorian history is immeasurable. However, other from the much contested Darksaber, there is still no in-universe discussion of Tarre Vizsla\'s politics or behaviours. The extremist Death Watch (which may have ties to the Children of the Watch as indicated by the armour insignia of Mandos who rescued a young Djarin), Bo-Katan Kryze\'s splintered Nite Owls from Death Watch, and New Mandalorians under Satine Kryze\'s pacifist rule which renounced weapons and beskar armor—all of these Mandalorians sects and practises were illuminated by \"Star Wars.\" Ask any Mandalorian their extensive view on Tarre Vizsla\'s historical influence, and you can be sure to get different responses.</p>\n<div class=\"vidad-container\"></div>\n<div class=\"teads-container\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">Tarre Vizsla\'s Eyes on the Future</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"755349\" data-slide-num=\"3\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/tarre-vizslas-eyes-on-the-future-1643836649.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/who-is-tarre-vizsla-the-first-mandalorian-jedi/tarre-vizslas-eyes-on-the-future-1643836649.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<a href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jedipedia/images/7/73/Statue_von_Tarre_Vizsla.png/revision/latest?cb=20200310104310&amp;path-prefix=de\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"gallery-image-credit\"><a href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jedipedia/images/7/73/Statue_von_Tarre_Vizsla.png/revision/latest?cb=20200310104310&amp;path-prefix=de\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Disney</span></a></span></a> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p>Even though Tarre Vizsla is a ghost, he is the ghost who lights up people who are close to the Darksaber. Notably, adoptive father figures are usually the ones who absorb Tarre Vizsla\'s story anytime his name has been mentioned so far (apart from \"Forces of Destiny\"). On-screen, Kanan Jarrus, the Jedi who taught Sabine Wren to use the sabre, was the one who originally received the legend of Tarre Vizsla. The Armorer now relays the information to Djarin, Grogu\'s Mandalorian protector.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p>One of the best \"Rebels\" episodes, \"Trials of the Darksaber,\" makes the point that your perspective and ethos in the galaxy are shaped by your family, whether by blood or by adoption. Sabine is a misfit Mandalorian who was unofficially \"adopted\" by a Jedi and trained with a lightsaber despite not being Force-sensitive. Grogu is a Force-sensitive non-human Jedi youngling who is adopted by a Mando in beskar, in a reversal of Sabine\'s upbringing. Djarin bestows Mandalorian heirlooms, including his Mando pendant and later, the beskar chainmail armour crafted by the Armorer, as a result of Grogu and Djarin\'s very strong bond. Although Djarin has paired Grogu with the Jedi Luke Skywalker, Djarin is determined to keep Grogu\'s Mandalorian connections in the forefront of his mind.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p>The weapon of Tarre Vizsla is put on a cloudy course as season 1 of \"The Book of Boba Fett\" ends and season 3 of \"The Mandalorian\" looms in the distance. The biggest difficulty is that Djarin has yet to develop the mental focus necessary to successfully use the Darksaber. The Armorer preaches, \"Your body is strong, but your mind is preoccupied.\" This is probably related to his internal struggles with his Mandalorian identity, including the fact that the Children of the Watch reject him despite the fact that he still upholds the beskar\'s beliefs. Fans believe that the noble Din Djarin, a Mando who was not descended from a powerful bloodline, is the perfect person to unite the different types of divided Mandalorians in order to reconstruct Mandalore. He cherishes solidarity, for one, while being a loner. Two, he might be able to learn more about Mandalorian history if he lives up to the Darksaber\'s symbolism of Mandalorian leadership. Din\'s background undermines the nobility ties that frequently go along with the Vizslas\' claim to the sword and leadership, much to Paz Vizsla\'s dismay.</p>\n<p>If Moff Gideon\'s taunt serves as any indication, Grogu might be the protagonist\'s choice to use the Darksaber (hopefully not involving him defeating Djarin). Thematically, it makes sense. One Mandalorian\'s cohesive Mando-Jedi history is represented by the Darksaber. Luke Skywalker presents Grogu with two options in Chapter 6 of \"The Book of Boba Fett\": the conventional lightsaber or the beskar chainmail armour.

Martin Scorsese has never lost his touch, but his biographical dark comedy quickly ranked among his finest work. Scorsese is no stranger to long runtimes, but crafting a three-hour black comedy that\'s consistently engaging is an amazing achievement.</p>\n<div id=\"primis-container\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sp = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search); if ( !sp || !sp.has(\"zsource\") || sp.get(\"zsource\") != \"snapchat\" ) { var s = document.createElement(\"SCRIPT\"); s.setAttribute(\"async\", \"async\"); s.type = \"text/javascript\"; s.language = \"javascript\"; s.src = \"https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=109328\"; document.getElementById(\"primis-container\").appendChild(s); }\n</script></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scorsese set the all-time record for <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/529647/the-wolf-of-wall-street-sets-record-for-uses-of-the-f-word-in-a-narrative-feature/\" target=\"_blank\">the most swearing in a film</a>, and the movie\'s excessive sex, drugs, and general debauchery courted controversy throughout its release. Some Academy Awards voters were so turned off by the explicit content that one even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/23/martin-scorsese-heckled-wolf-of-wall-street-screening-sex-drugs\" target=\"_blank\">heckled Scorsese at the official screening</a>, but \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" still ended up with five major Oscar nominations.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Among them was Leonardo DiCaprio\'s nomination for best actor. DiCaprio is one of the most versatile actors of his generation, but the role of Jordan Belfort was unlike anything he\'d ever attempted. A corrupt stockbroker who scams investors with ridiculous schemes, Belfort curates a loyal following of hooligans who wreak havoc on Wall Street, throwing wild parties and using their influence to avoid the attention of authorities.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The film\'s entire cast is terrific. Jonah Hill earned his second Oscar nomination for best supporting actor, and Margot Robbie turned in her breakout role. Matthew McConaughey\'s eccentric, chest-thumping character Mark Hanna became an instant fan-favorite. Scorsese\'s director friends, including Jon Faverau, Spike Jonze, and Rob Reiner, all have fun cameos.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you loved \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" give these films a shot too.</p>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">War Dogs</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"1\" data-post-id=\"633302\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/war-dogs-1634234562.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/war-dogs-1634234562.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/war-dogs-1634234562.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/slide/war-dogs/\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"1\" data-slide-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching: War Dogs\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" alt=\"Jonah Hill wearing sunglasses\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Warner Brothers</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder  added-content\">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Jonah Hill may have started his career with comedic roles in \"Superbad,\" \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,\" and \"Get Him to the Greek,\" but he showed his dramatic range for the first time with \"Moneyball.\" Hill\'s performance in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" allowed him to combine both sides of his filmography; Donnie Azoff is an uproariously funny character, but the ramifications of his corrupt behavior are treated very seriously. Hill had a similar role in Todd Phillips\'s 2016 film \"War Dogs.\"</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"War Dogs,\" a black comedy, has a similar tone to \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" and both films are told from the perspective of real criminals. Hill stars as the eccentric arms dealer Efraim Diveroli, who convinces his childhood best friend David Packouz (Miles Teller) to join his operation. Efraim sells ammunition and supplies to the US Army to support the war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Efraim and David gradually learn that their weapons kill millions. David is shell-shocked and begins to question their actions, but Efraim shows almost no regret and wants to keep lining his pockets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like Donnie in \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" Efraim is an unlikeable character who is nonetheless quite entertaining. Todd Phillips has never been shy about his love of Scorsese, and his depiction of real events is indebted to Scorsese\'s style. Phillips doesn\'t absolve the characters of their crimes, but seems fascinated by how these seemingly harmless men became so dangerous.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">After Hours</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"2\" data-post-id=\"633302\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/after-hours-1634234562.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/after-hours-1634234562.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/after-hours-1634234562.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/slide/after-hours/\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"2\" data-slide-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching: After Hours\" width=\"780\" height=\"438\" alt=\"Griffin Dunne sits at table\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Warner Brothers</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder \">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Scorsese is often thought of as a purely serious filmmaker, but he\'s frequently shown that he has a great sense of humor. Films like \"Goodfellas\" and \"The King of Comedy\" pepper their dramatic stories with dark jokes, and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was Scorsese\'s funniest film to date. However, it wasn\'t the first time that the director tackled a zany premise. Scorsese\'s 1985 film \"After Hours\" may not have been showered with the praise his more famous features received, but the underrated classic is among his greatest achievements.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"After Hours\" follows measly data analyst Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) during the worst night of his life. Paul has little charisma, but works up the confidence to talk to the illustrious sculptor Marcy Franklin (Rosanna Arquette). During his trip to her apartment, Paul loses all of his money, and after the date goes awry he\'s left stranded in the city without any way to call for help. As Paul makes enemies with the unusual characters who roam the streets at night, the situation escalates, and the entire metroplex begins a manhunt for the lowly desk worker.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scorsese has been accused of promoting toxic masculinity with his films, but both \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"After Hours\" earnestly depict male anxiety. Paul is diminutive, but feels guilty throughout the story as he becomes circumstantially involved in various crimes.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n																		<div class=\"vidad-container\"></div>\n							<div class=\"teads-container\"></div>\n															</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">Wall Street</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"3\" data-post-id=\"633302\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/wall-street-1634234562.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/wall-street-1634234562.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/wall-street-1634234562.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/slide/wall-street/\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"3\" data-slide-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching: Wall Street\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" alt=\"Michael Douglas tricks Charlie Sheen\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">20th Century Fox</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder  added-content\">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was revelatory with its nuanced depiction of stockbroker culture and the reality of the American financial system. The Wall Street tycoon character is often a caricature in films, but \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" explored the complex trading system and the people behind it in detail. It is simultaneously fascinating and infuriating. The only film that rivals its impact is Oliver Stone\'s 1987 classic \"Wall Street.\" Like Scorsese, Stone is a political filmmaker who uses his movies to express timely opinions. \"Wall Street\" is immensely entertaining, but also a dire prophecy about the evils of these seemingly trusted institutions.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Wall Street\" follows idealistic trader Buddy Fox (Charlie Sheen) as he travels to New York City to begin a new position at the renowned Jackson Steinem &amp; Company. Fox finds a potential mentor in the legendary stockbroker Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglas). Gecko is initially unimpressed by Bud\'s pitches, but begins to weaponize the young man\'s naivete and uses him to spy on financial rivals. Bud is deceived into taking part in a criminal plot that leaves his father Carl (Martin Sheen) and the members of his union unemployed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both Bud and Gecko share qualities with Jordan Belfort. Like Bud, Belfort begins innocently, and is corrupted by the lavish Wall Street lifestyle; the difference is that Bud recognizes his failings and looks to amend them. The charismatic showmanship of Gecko is closer to what Belfort actually becomes; Douglas\' brilliant performance earned him an Academy Award for best actor.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"4\" data-post-id=\"633302\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/wall-street-money-never-sleeps-1634234562.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/wall-street-money-never-sleeps-1634234562.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/wall-street-money-never-sleeps-1634234562.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/slide/wall-street-money-never-sleeps/\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"4\" data-slide-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching: Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" alt=\"Michael Douglas walks with Shia Labeouf\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">20th Century Fox</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder \">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">A sequel to \"Wall Street\" was unexpected, but Stone returned to the Gecko character in his 2010 follow up, \"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.\" Picking up decades after his imprisonment, the film opens with a penniless Gecko returning to rebuild his empire. Gecko utilizes his notorious reputation to promote his new book \"Is Greed Good?\" in a fun reference to the first film. But compared to the frequent insider trading and corporate fraud cases of the 2008 financial crisis, Gecko\'s crimes now seem quaint.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Money Never Sleeps\" shows a more sympathetic side to Gecko. His daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) has distanced herself from her father, and dates the trader Jacob Moore (Shia Labeouf), an idealist like Bud. Gecko sees him as another protege, but Moore doesn\'t want to associate himself with the infamous criminal. However, the two are forced to work together when the owner of a rival firm, Bretton James (Josh Brolin), attempts to destroy both of their reputations with a scam.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Douglas explores a weariness that tempers his initially charismatic performance; getting away with malicious activities is too common to deliver any sort of thrill. Winnie is understandably hesitant about trusting her father; she seeks to build an honorable practice, despite the familial ties that haunt her reputation. Brolin is a very different type of villain, and his shrewdness is terrifying when compared to the upbeat energy that Douglas had in the first film. The complexity of 21st trading should appeal to \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" fans.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">The Founder</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"5\" data-post-id=\"633302\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/the-founder-1634234562.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/the-founder-1634234562.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/the-founder-1634234562.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/slide/the-founder/\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"5\" data-slide-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching: The Founder\" width=\"780\" height=\"438\" alt=\"Michael Keaton in front of McDonalds\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">The Weinstein Company</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder  added-content\">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The origin of the McDonald\'s fast-food chain might not seem as inherently exciting as Jordan Belfort\'s drug-fueled parties, but the insightful biographical drama \"The Founder\" showed that the beginnings of America\'s top burger joint were not quite as friendly as its branding suggests. \"The Founder\" reveals how investment shark Ray Croc (Michael Keaton) used dirty trading and illicit legal maneuvering to wrestle control of the franchise from its creators, Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Caroll Lynch) McDonald.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like Belfort, Croc doesn\'t immediately seem very threatening or ambitious. A failed milkshake machine salesman who works a grueling job traveling between cities, Croc faces financial ruin that could force him to mortgage his home. In addition, his marriage to Ethel (Laura Dern) is falling apart. However, Croc does have Belfort\'s conviction. The McDonald brothers have created an innovative system that produces food at a speedy rate, and Croc sees the potential in expanding the local oddity into a nationwide empire.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, Croc\'s greed destroys the quality assurances that the McDonalds brothers had seen as integral to their mission. Croc uses the opportunity to line his own pockets — like Belfort, he doesn\'t care about the damage he causes along the way.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">I, Tonya</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"6\" data-post-id=\"633302\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/i-tonya-1634234562.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/i-tonya-1634234562.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/i-tonya-1634234562.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/slide/i-tonya/\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"6\" data-slide-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching: I, Tonya\" width=\"780\" height=\"438\" alt=\"Margot Robbie skating at the Olympics\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Neon</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder \">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Although DiCaprio and Hill delivered award-nominated performances in \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" the film also featured a breakthrough part for Margot Robbie. Before \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" the Australian star was relatively unknown, but her role as Belfort\'s doomed love interest Naomi Lapaglia instantly earned her critical acclaim.

Tonya is pushed to physical and emotional extremes, but she\'s a victim of abuse from both her mother and husband, Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan).

It also explained financial malpractice in detail. Deceitful figures like Belfort intentionally confuse their clients, and the film breaks the fourth wall to allow DiCaprio to directly explain his scheme to the viewers.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writer-director Adam McKay used a similar technique in \"The Big Short.\" The film explores the events that led up to the 2008 financial crisis, following the men who realized the system was doomed to collapse after it was already too late. Like Scorsese, McKay utilized untraditional satirical elements to explain the nuanced system in an understandable way. The film incorporates news footage, features cameos by celebrities like Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez, makes bold soundtrack choices, and even points out when its recreation of key moments isn\'t entirely accurate. It\'s often fun to watch, but McKay gravely reflects on the crisis\' human costs during the film\'s final moments.</p>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">American Psycho</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"8\" data-post-id=\"633302\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/american-psycho-1634234562.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/american-psycho-1634234562.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/american-psycho-1634234562.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/slide/american-psycho/\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"8\" data-slide-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching: American Psycho\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" alt=\"Christian Bale swings axe\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Lionsgate</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder \">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Films that explore Wall Street culture often face the challenge of what perspective to tell the story from. The environment inherently draws out unlikeable characters, and it can be challenging to watch a story through the eyes of someone unsympathetic. To address this, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" leans into Jordan Belfort\'s complexity. He\'s the epitome of toxic masculinity, and DiCaprio explores how such a villainous figure could become so influential, as well as the culture that allowed him to thrive.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2000\'s \"American Psycho\" addresses similar themes, again by using the corruption of the New York finance world and black comedy. Belfort may have harbored disaster, but Christian Bale\'s Patrick Bateman is a straight up slasher villain. Bateman is a successful investment banker, and like Belfort he luxuriates with all of the benefits of his wealth. He lives in a lavish apartment, attends fancy restaurants, employs expensive sex workers, and prizes his personal business cards.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, Bateman is also a serial killer who hooks victims with his charisma. Watching Bateman graphically murder his obnoxious co-worker Paul Allen (Jared Leto) to the tune of \"It\'s Hip to Be Square\" is hilarious and terrifying all at once. Both DiCaprio and Bale play characters whose public fronts and private dealings are vastly different; both men can continue their deceptions thanks to their magnetic personalities. It\'s ironic that \"American Psycho\" was initially <a href=\"https://hollywoodsuite.ca/this-is-not-an-exit-the-legacy-of-american-psycho/\" target=\"_blank\">criticized for promoting toxic masculinity</a>, as it\'s directed by female filmmaker Mary Harron and can easily be read as a condemnation of Bateman\'s behavior, not an endorsement.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">Margin Call</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"9\" data-post-id=\"633302\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/margin-call-1634234562.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/margin-call-1634234562.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/margin-call-1634234562.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/slide/margin-call/\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"9\" data-slide-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching: Margin Call\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" alt=\"Zachary Quinto in business meeting\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Roadside Attractions</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder  added-content\">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" succeeds in exploring Wall Street culture thanks to its epic runtime, which gives Scorsese the freedom to tell the story over several decades. Instead of cramming the various crimes into a more traditional structure that wouldn\'t have gone into as much depth, Scorsese shows how years of excess built up to a tipping point.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Margin Call\" does the exact opposite. The 2011 debut writer-director J.C. Chandor follows the crash of a powerful Wall Street investment bank over the course of a couple of hours, and is framed as a real-time thriller. The themes of capitalistic greed and denial at the highest level are similar to those in \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" and both have a disastrous conclusion. In addition, \"Margin Call\" is equally effective at fleshing out its shocking revelations in the moments before their impact is felt. Although much more serious, Chandor\'s script is just as sharp and witty as Terence Winter\'s screenplay for \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" — both writers received Academy Award nominations for their work.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">Rogue Trader</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"10\" data-post-id=\"633302\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/rogue-trader-1634234562.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/rogue-trader-1634234562.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/rogue-trader-1634234562.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/slide/rogue-trader/\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"10\" data-slide-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching: Rogue Trader\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" alt=\"Ewan McGregor looks at paperwork\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Pathe Distribution</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder \">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is a distinctly American film, but other films about investment malpractice have explored how issues of greed and consumerism permeate around the globe. One of the most underrated financial thrillers ever made is the British 1999 biographical drama \"Rogue Trader.\" The film tells the true story of Nick Leeson (Ewan McGregor), an ambitious young trader whose greed inadvertently brings down Great Britain\'s oldest merchant bank, Barings.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like Belfort, Leeson\'s youthful energy runs rampant during his early success. He quickly wows the bank\'s senior associates with his expert tracking abilities and profitable deals. However, Leeson hides many of the same secrets; he\'s a serial gambler who hides his losses on company accounts. As the extent of his actions are revealed, Leeson is initially protected by powerful London tycoons who want to maintain the current state of affairs. However, like Belfort, Leeson is ultimately forced to go to jail and reflect on the harm he has caused.</p>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n    <div class=\"news-article   \">\n			\n							                    <h2 class=\"\">Glengarry Glen Ross</h2>\n				\n				<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap  \" data-slide-num=\"11\" data-post-id=\"633302\">\n											\n																					<picture>\n																	<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/glengarry-glen-ross-1634234562.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n									<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/glengarry-glen-ross-1634234562.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n																<img class=\"gallery-image lazyload \" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/glengarry-glen-ross-1634234562.jpg\" data-slide-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/slide/glengarry-glen-ross/\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"11\" data-slide-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching: Glengarry Glen Ross\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" alt=\"Alec Baldwin yelling next to chalkboard\">\n							</source></source></picture>\n																				<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">New Line Cinema</span>									</div>\n\n				\n				<div class=\"columns-holder  added-content\">\n															<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">DiCaprio is incredible in \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" but the entire ensemble turns in brilliant performances. Scorsese recruited a murderer\'s row of great character actors for the film, including Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernthal, Kyle Chandler, Jean Dujardin, Shea Whigham, and Thomas Middleditch. The precision that each actor brings to their roles fleshes out the corporate world, recalling 1992\'s \"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" which tackles finance with a similarly stacked cast.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play, \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" follows real estate salesmen who are fired amidst a top-level restructuring of their firm, Mitch and Murray.

In the film, Belfort addresses the audience by breaking the fourth wall, and alludes to instances when the film isn\'t entirely being accurate. Michael Winterbottom\'s 2002 biographical comedy-drama \"24 Hour Party People\" also uses an unreliable narrator to tell its story. While the setting — the British punk rock scene — is vastly different from the one in \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" the film has a similar tone, reflecting on real tragedies through a comedic lens.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tony Wilson (Steve Coogan) witnesses the rise and fall of punk culture, first as a journalist at Granada Television, and later as an employee of Factory Records. Wilson sees the early days of major artists like A Certain Ratio, Happy Mondays, The Durutti Column, and Joy Division (which transformed into New Order). Like \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" the story spans several decades as punk grows and declines.

Both are unafraid to take bold stylistic risks, and both have a keen attention to detail. Soderbergh is also fascinated by the financial world, and his 2009 film \"The Informant!\" approaches its material with a tone that should remind you of \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" Based on the nonfiction novel by Kurt Eichenwald, the film tells the true story of whistleblower Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon), who exposed the lysine price-fixing conspiracy.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-width=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whitacre is a top salesman at an Illinois commodity trading firm, and is recruited as an FBI informant after he discovers the price-fixing practices hidden in the company\'s commercial expenses. Like DiCaprio, Damon is renowned as a dramatic actor, so it\'s fun to see him play an idiosyncratic and awkward character. Damon\'s heightened anxiety when he\'s called to collect evidence is often uproarious, and he brings vulnerability to the role as Whitacre collapses under the pressures of his commitments.</p>\n\n					\n									</div>\n					</div>\n\n\n</article>', 'https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/intro-1634234782.jpg', 'article class=\"news-post\">\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p q4\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"q4-top\" data-ad-width=\"any\" id=\"adslot-q4top\"></div>\n<div class=\"main-article\">\n<h1 class=\"title-gallery\" data-post-id=\"633302\" id=\"title-gallery\">13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching</h1>\n</div>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap lead-image-holder\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-post-title=\"13 Movies Like The Wolf Of Wall Street That Are Definitely Worth Watching\" data-post-url=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/633302/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/\" data-slide-num=\"0\">\n<picture>\n<source media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/intro-1634234782.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/intro-1634234782.sm.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Paramount Pictures</span> </div>\n<div class=\"byline-container\"><span class=\"byline-by\">By</span> <a class=\"byline-author\" href=\"/author/liamgaughan/\"><a class=\"byline-author\" href=\"/author/liamgaughan/\">Liam Gaughan</a></a><span class=\"byline-timestamp\"><span class=\"byline-slash\">/</span>Oct. 14, 2021  2:09 pm EDT</span></div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the best movies of the twenty-first century is \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" Although Martin Scorsese has never lost his touch, his dark comedic biographical film immediately rose to the top of the list of his best. Long running times are nothing new for Scorsese, but creating a three-hour black comedy that is continually entertaining is an incredible feat.</p>\n<div id=\"primis-container\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sp = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search); if ( !sp || !sp.has(\"zsource\") || sp.get(\"zsource\") != \"snapchat\" ) { var s = document.createElement(\"SCRIPT\"); s.setAttribute(\"async\", \"async\"); s.type = \"text/javascript\"; s.language = \"javascript\"; s.src = \"https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=109328\"; document.getElementById(\"primis-container\").appendChild(s); }\n</script></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scorsese broke the record for the most profanity in a movie, and the film\'s heavy use of drugs, sex, and general decadence courted controversy for the duration of its theatrical run. The sexual language turned off some Academy Award voters to the point where one heckled Scorsese at the formal screening, yet \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" nevertheless received five significant Oscar nominations.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Leonardo DiCaprio received a nomination for best actor among them. Despite being one of the most adaptable actors of his generation, DiCaprio had never attempted a part like Jordan Belfort. Belfort, a dishonest stockbroker who defrauds investors with absurd schemes, cultivates a devoted following of thugs who wreck havoc on Wall Street by throwing crazy parties and using their influence to evade law enforcement.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The entire cast of the movie is excellent. Margot Robbie played her breakthrough role, and Jonah Hill received his second nomination for best supporting actor at the Oscars. Mark Hanna, played by Matthew McConaughey, is an eccentric, chest-thumping character who quickly won over fans. Fun cameos are made by several of Scorsese\'s director friends, including Rob Reiner, Spike Jonze, and Jon Favreau.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Give these movies a try if \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was your favourite.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">War Dogs</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"1\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/war-dogs-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/war-dogs-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Warner Brothers</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">While Jonah Hill may have begun his career with humorous parts in \"Superbad,\" \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,\" and \"Get Him to the Greek,\" \"Moneyball\" marked the first time he displayed his emotional ability. Hill was able to merge both aspects of his filmography in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\"; Donnie Azoff is a hilarious character, but the consequences of his corrupt actions are taken very seriously. In Todd Phillips\' 2016 movie \"War Dogs,\" Hill played a similar role.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Black comedy \"War Dogs\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" have comparable tones and are both narrated from the viewpoint of actual criminals. Hill plays the eccentric armaments dealer Efraim Diveroli, who persuades Miles Teller\'s character David Packouz, his childhood best friend, to join his business. Efraim provides the US Army with supplies and munitions to aid in the war activities in Afghanistan and Iraq. David and Efraim gradually come to understand that their weapons murder millions of people. David is stunned and starts to wonder why they did what they did, but Efraim exhibits hardly any remorse and wants to keep filling his pockets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Similarly to Donnie in \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" Efraim is a dislikeable guy but also a lot of fun. Todd Phillips has never been secretive about his admiration for Martin Scorsese, and his portrayal of actual events is influenced by Scorsese\'s aesthetic. Phillips doesn\'t excuse the characters\' acts, but he appears intrigued by how these otherwise amiable men became into such dangers.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">After Hours</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"2\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/after-hours-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/after-hours-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Warner Brothers</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Although Scorsese is generally seen as a strictly serious director, he frequently demonstrates that he has a fantastic sense of humour. Dark humour may be seen in movies like \"Goodfellas\" and \"The King of Comedy,\" while \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is Scorsese\'s funniest work to date. But that wasn\'t the first time the director had taken on an absurd notion. Even though Scorsese\'s 1985 picture \"After Hours\" didn\'t garner the same recognition as some of his more well-known works, it is still one of his finest works.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the hardest night of his life, \"After Hours\" follows meagre data analyst Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne). Paul struggles to gain the confidence to speak with the famous sculptor Marcy Franklin despite having no charisma (Rosanna Arquette). Paul loses all of his money on the way to her place, and when the date doesn\'t work out, he is left stuck in the city without a way to call for assistance. The situation worsens as Paul develops animosity against the strange characters that prowl the streets at night, and the entire metroplex launches a quest for the poor desk worker.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although Scorsese has been accused of using his movies to advance toxic masculinity, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"After Hours\" both truly portray male fear. Paul, a small character in the novel, feels guilty throughout as he unwittingly participates in different crimes.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<div class=\"vidad-container\"></div>\n<div class=\"teads-container\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">Wall Street</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"3\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/wall-street-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/wall-street-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">20th Century Fox</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">With its sophisticated portrayal of stockbroker culture and the reality of the American financial system, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was revelatory. The Wall Street tycoon figure is frequently a caricature in movies, but \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" extensively examined the intricate trading system and its participants. It is both fascinating and annoying at the same time. Only Oliver Stone\'s 1987 blockbuster \"Wall Street\" has a similar impact. Stone is a political filmmaker who utilises his films to express current viewpoints, much like Scorsese. While \"Wall Street\" is incredibly amusing, it also serves as a warning about the sinister nature of these ostensibly reliable institutions.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Buddy Fox (Charlie Sheen), an optimistic trader, is followed in \"Wall Street\" as he makes his way to New York City to start a new job at the prestigious Jackson Steinem &amp; Company. Fox discovers Gordon Gecko, a renowned stockbroker, as a prospective mentor (Michael Douglas). Initially unimpressed by Bud\'s sales efforts, Gecko starts to weaponize the young man\'s innocence and employs him as a snoop on business rivals. Bud gets tricked into participating in a criminal scheme that renders his father Carl (Martin Sheen) and the union members jobless.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bud and Gecko both have traits in common with Jordan Belfort. Similar to Bud, Belfort starts out pure before becoming corrupted by the opulent Wall Street lifestyle; the difference is that Bud admits his faults and works to improve them. Belfort\'s genuine persona is more akin to the dazzling showmanship of Gecko; Douglas\' outstanding performance earned him an Academy Award for best actor.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"4\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/wall-street-money-never-sleeps-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/wall-street-money-never-sleeps-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">20th Century Fox</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">It was unexpected that there would be a \"Wall Street\" sequel, but Stone brought back the Gecko in the 2010 film \"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.\" The movie begins with a penniless Gecko returning to rebuild his business, decades after his imprisonment. In a playful allusion to the previous movie, Gecko uses his renowned reputation to advertise his new book, \"Is Greed Good?\" However, Gecko\'s misdeeds now look insignificant in comparison to the numerous insider trading and corporate fraud instances of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gecko is seen in \"Money Never Sleeps\" in a more sympathetic light. His daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan), an idealist like Bud, has grown apart from her father and is dating the trader Jacob Moore (Shia Labeouf). Moore doesn\'t want to be associated with the notorious felon, even if Gecko regards him as another one of his proteges. But when Bretton James (Josh Brolin), the boss of a rival company, tries to ruin both of their names with a swindle, the two are forced to cooperate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being able to get away with cruel behaviour is just too common to provide any sort of excitement, and Douglas explores a weariness that tempers his initially dazzling performance. Winnie is understandably apprehensive to place her trust in her father since, despite the family ties that cast a shadow over her reputation, she wants to establish a respectable practise. Compared to the joyful energy that Douglas had in the previous movie, Brolin is an entirely different kind of villain, and his cunning is terrifying. Fans of \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" should like the sophistication of 21st-century trading.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">The Founder</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"5\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/the-founder-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/the-founder-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">The Weinstein Company</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Although Jordan Belfort\'s drug-fueled parties may appear more thrilling than the origins of the McDonald\'s fast food company, the enlightening historical drama \"The Founder\" revealed that the beginnings of America\'s favourite burger establishment were not quite as welcoming as its branding promises. The movie \"The Founder\" shows how businessman Ray Croc (Michael Keaton) seized control of the chain from its founders Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Caroll Lynch) McDonald through shady business dealings and illegal legal manoeuvres.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Croc, like Belfort, doesn\'t come across as particularly frightening or ambitious at first. Croc, an unsuccessful milkshake machine salesman who toils away between towns, is on the verge of bankruptcy and may have to take out a mortgage on his house. Additionally, his union with Ethel (Laura Dern) is disintegrating. Croc does, however, possess Belfort\'s conviction. The McDonald brothers have developed a novel method that produces food quickly, and Croc sees the opportunity to turn the regional oddity into a vast international empire.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The McDonald brothers had considered quality assurances to be essential to their goal, but Croc\'s greed kills them. Like Belfort, Croc takes advantage of the situation to enrich himself; he doesn\'t give a damn about the collateral harm.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">I, Tonya</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"6\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/i-tonya-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/i-tonya-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Neon</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Although \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" included award-nominated performances from DiCaprio and Hill, Margot Robbie also had a breakthrough role in the movie. The Australian actress was largely unknown prior to \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" but she received immediate praise from critics for her portrayal of Belfort\'s tragic love interest Naomi Lapaglia. Although she frequently benefits from her husband\'s wealth, Naomi had to match or perhaps surpass DiCaprio\'s magnetism in the demanding part. She also had to be the uncommon sympathetic figure in the movie.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Four years later, in the biopic \"I, Tonya,\" which has a similar feel to \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" Robbie gave one of her best performances to date. The movie reveals the intricacies of the Tonya Harding controversy, a widely-covered true criminal narrative with equally ridiculous elements.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LaVona Golden, the young Tonya\'s controlling mother, encourages her to strive for excellence (Alison Janney, in an Academy Award-winning role). Tonya is abused by both her mother and her husband, Jeff Gillooly, forcing her to the brink of physical and emotional collapse (Sebastian Stan). Tonya makes it to the Olympics despite having a difficult upbringing, and there she becomes involved in a plot to seriously harm her closest opponent Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver).</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">The Big Short</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"7\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/the-big-short-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/the-big-short-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Paramount Pictures</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The corruption-prone culture on Wall Street was not the only thing \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" revealed. It also gave a thorough explanation of financial malpractice. Belfort and other dishonest characters deliberately mislead their clients, and the movie breaks the fourth wall to let DiCaprio describe his plan to the audience in full.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In \"The Big Short,\" writer-director Adam McKay employed a similar strategy. The film explores the events that led up to the 2008 financial crisis, following the men who realized the system was doomed to collapse after it was already too late. Like Scorsese, McKay utilized untraditional satirical elements to explain the nuanced system in an understandable way. The film incorporates news footage, features cameos by celebrities like Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez, makes bold soundtrack choices, and even points out when its recreation of key moments isn\'t entirely accurate. It\'s often fun to watch, but McKay gravely reflects on the crisis\' human costs during the film\'s final moments.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">American Psycho</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"8\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/american-psycho-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/american-psycho-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Lionsgate</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Films that explore Wall Street culture often face the challenge of what perspective to tell the story from. The environment inherently draws out unlikeable characters, and it can be challenging to watch a story through the eyes of someone unsympathetic. To address this, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" leans into Jordan Belfort\'s complexity. He\'s the epitome of toxic masculinity, and DiCaprio explores how such a villainous figure could become so influential, as well as the culture that allowed him to thrive.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2000\'s \"American Psycho\" addresses similar themes, again by using the corruption of the New York finance world and black comedy. Belfort may have harbored disaster, but Christian Bale\'s Patrick Bateman is a straight up slasher villain. Bateman is a successful investment banker, and like Belfort he luxuriates with all of the benefits of his wealth. He lives in a lavish apartment, attends fancy restaurants, employs expensive sex workers, and prizes his personal business cards.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, Bateman is also a serial killer who hooks victims with his charisma. Watching Bateman graphically murder his obnoxious co-worker Paul Allen (Jared Leto) to the tune of \"It\'s Hip to Be Square\" is hilarious and terrifying all at once. Both DiCaprio and Bale play characters whose public fronts and private dealings are vastly different; both men can continue their deceptions thanks to their magnetic personalities. It\'s ironic that \"American Psycho\" was initially<a href=\"https://hollywoodsuite.ca/this-is-not-an-exit-the-legacy-of-american-psycho/\" target=\"_blank\">criticized for promoting toxic masculinity</a>, as it\'s directed by female filmmaker Mary Harron and can easily be read as a condemnation of Bateman\'s behavior, not an endorsement.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">Margin Call</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"9\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/margin-call-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/margin-call-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Roadside Attractions</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" succeeds in exploring Wall Street culture thanks to its epic runtime, which gives Scorsese the freedom to tell the story over several decades. Instead of cramming the various crimes into a more traditional structure that wouldn\'t have gone into as much depth, Scorsese shows how years of excess built up to a tipping point.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Margin Call\" does the exact opposite. The 2011 debut writer-director J.C. Chandor follows the crash of a powerful Wall Street investment bank over the course of a couple of hours, and is framed as a real-time thriller. The themes of capitalistic greed and denial at the highest level are similar to those in \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" and both have a disastrous conclusion. In addition, \"Margin Call\" is equally effective at fleshing out its shocking revelations in the moments before their impact is felt. Although much more serious, Chandor\'s script is just as sharp and witty as Terence Winter\'s screenplay for \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" both writers received Academy Award nominations for their work.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">Rogue Trader</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"10\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/rogue-trader-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/rogue-trader-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Pathe Distribution</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is a distinctly American film, but other films about investment malpractice have explored how issues of greed and consumerism permeate around the globe.

In the film, Belfort addresses the audience by breaking the fourth wall, and alludes to instances when the film isn\'t entirely being accurate. Michael Winterbottom\'s 2002 biographical comedy-drama \"24 Hour Party People\" also uses an unreliable narrator to tell its story. While the setting the British punk rock scene is vastly different from the one in \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" the film has a similar tone, reflecting on real tragedies through a comedic lens.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tony Wilson (Steve Coogan) witnesses the rise and fall of punk culture, first as a journalist at Granada Television, and later as an employee of Factory Records. Wilson sees the early days of major artists like A Certain Ratio, Happy Mondays, The Durutti Column, and Joy Division (which transformed into New Order). Like \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" the story spans several decades as punk grows and declines. Coogan\'s Wilson is a much more likable character than Belfort, but his musings are just as hilarious.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"news-article\">\n<h2 class=\"\">The Informant!</h2>\n<div class=\"slide-key image-holder gallery-image-holder credit-image-wrap\" data-post-id=\"633302\" data-slide-num=\"13\">\n<picture>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/the-informant-1634234562.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 429px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n<source data-srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/movies-like-the-wolf-of-wall-street-that-are-definitely-worth-watching/the-informant-1634234562.sm.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 428px)\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n\n</picture>\n<span class=\"gallery-image-credit\">Warner Brothers</span> </div>\n<div class=\"columns-holder added-content\">\n<p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Steven Soderbergh and Martin Scorsese are similar directors in many ways. Both are unafraid to take bold stylistic risks, and both have a keen attention to detail. Soderbergh is also fascinated by the financial world, and his 2009 film \"The Informant!\" approaches its material with a tone that should remind you of \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" Based on the nonfiction novel by Kurt Eichenwald, the film tells the true story of whistleblower Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon), who exposed the lysine price-fixing conspiracy.</p>\n<div class=\"google-ad-placeholder between-p\" data-ad-height=\"any\" data-ad-pos=\"between-p\" data-ad-width=\"any\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whitacre is a top salesman at an Illinois commodity trading firm, and is recruited as an FBI informant after he discovers the price-fixing practices hidden in the company\'s commercial expenses. Like DiCaprio, Damon is renowned as a dramatic actor, so it\'s fun to see him play an idiosyncratic and awkward character. Damon\'s heightened anxiety when he\'s called to collect evidence is often uproarious, and he brings vulnerability to the role as Whitacre collapses under the pressures of his commitments.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article', b'1', 1, b'1');
